# Simple smart contract Project

This project demonstrates a basic smart contract that sets and gets a message. 
I used hardhart do deploy due to its compatility with solidity and deloyed it on sepolia testnet.
I used ether js for integration. 
I used react for the frontend.
This is the contract address: 0x4767E956943e5b5518ed80A18eb9317Ed104BBED
